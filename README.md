# Contentful Export Tool

This tool simplifies exporting data from Contentful to a local json file. It's easier to use than the actual Contentful CLI export and can also be easily integrated into a CI/CD pipeline such as GitLab or GitHub.

> Note: This is NOT the official Contentful CLI Export tool. That can be found on [GitHub ðŸ”—](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli) or [NpmJS ðŸ”—](https://www.npmjs.com/package/contentful-cli)

## âœ¨ Features

- **Ease of Use:** Compared to the actual Contentful CLI, this tool requires less manual configuration and is more straightforward to use.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** It is designed to be used as part of a CI/CD pipeline, like GitLab or GitHub. Differently from the official Contentful CLI, it doesn't require a global installation, making it portable and easy to run in various environments.
- **Command Line Parameters:** All necessary parameters can be passed via command line arguments, making it flexible for different use cases. These include management-token, space-id and environment-id, making it even more suitable for being integrated into a release pipeline.
- **ZIP Compression:** This tool provides an option to compress the result into a ZIP file. This is particularly useful when exporting large amounts of data or assets, helping to save storage space.
- **Consistent Naming:** The naming of the output files (.json, .zip, and .log) are consistent and predictable, making it easier to manage the exported data (current date + space-id + environment-id).

## ðŸ’¡ Installation

To use this cli script, you must have [NodeJS ðŸ”—](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm ðŸ”—](http://npmjs.org) installed.

To install it, simply run:

```shell
npm install contentful-cli-export --save
```

Or, if using [yarn ðŸ”—](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/):

```shell
yarn add contentful-cli-export
```

### Requirements

* `node` >= 14.0.0
* `npm` >= 8.5.5
* `contentful-management` >= 7.50.0 
* `contentful-export` >= 7.18.7
* [contentful-lib-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/contentful-lib-helpers) >= 1.8.0

### Set-up

* To better use the Contentful CLI Export, it is recommended to put the following values in your `.env`/`.env.local` file:

    ```shell
    CMS_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=<management-token>
    CMS_SPACE_ID=<space-id>
    CMS_MAX_ALLOWED_LIMIT=100
    ```

    However, these values could also be passed as parameters during execution.

* Also, it is needed that you create an `export/` folder in the root of your project. It will contain all the exports.

## ðŸ“Ÿ Example

The basic command should contain the `from` environment we want to export from:

```shell
npx contentful-cli-export --from "<environment-id>"
```

A more complex export command could be

```shell
npx contentful-cli-export --from "<environment-id>" --space-id"<space-id>" --management-token "<management-token>" --compress
```

This will export data from the specified environment-id, space-id, and management token, and compress the result into a ZIP file.

## ðŸŽ¹ Usage

This script can be used from the command line and accepts various arguments for customization:

* `--from` or `--environment-id` [MANDATORY]: The environment id from which data will be exported.
* `--space-id`: The Contentful space id.
* `--management-token` or `--mt`: The Contentful Management Token.
* `--only-published`: To include only published data.
* `--download-assets`: To include assets in the exported data.
* `--verbose`: Display the progress in new lines, instead of animated UI (useful in CI).
* `--compress`: To compress the result into a ZIP file.
* `--export-dir`: To specify a custom directory for the exported data (default is sub-directory `export/` in your project root).
* `--max-allowed-limit`: Number of entries to fetch at each iteration. Max: `1000` - Recommended: `100` (lower values fire more API calls, but avoid 'Response too big' error).

## ðŸ“… Todo

* Add compatibility with official Contentful Export env/settings.
